Hi! I am Guilherme, a PhD in Chemistry with experience in Analytical Instrumentation, Signal Processing and Data Analysis of molecular data.

I have used scripting and programming as tools for my scientific work for a while, and I decided recently that I want to focus my activities 
on coding for applications in (analytical) instrumentation and analysis of (chemical) data.

I have experience with:
- Signal Processing of Instrumental Data;
- Evaluation/Statistical Modelling of Molecular Data;
- Analytical Instrumentation (Mass Spectrometry, Chromatography, Electrochemistry).
- Interfacing analytical instrumentation (using microcontrollers and commercial hardware);

I am also interested in:
- Developing portable and low cost analytical methods and instrumentation;
- Laboratory Automation and Automated data workflows;
- Process Control (no experience with this yet).

In case you want to contact me, feel free to e-mail me at guilhermelb [at] alumni.usp.br .

All the best!
